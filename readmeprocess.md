### BOOTSTRAP ASSIGNMENT
# Portfolio

* For this process my first move was to mock up a layout as it is easier to get into it with a plan in mind to avoid the possible problems with not knowing what to do next or getting too off track.

* I used a free piece of software from adobe called XD for this. I didn't add any colour, just basic framework so I understood where the components of the page would live.

* The next step I took was to create each .html page.

* Once these were up I started by making a simple centered nav at the top. It is a little different than a traditional "navbar" but personally I liked the simplicity of it.

* After I settled on the nav I moved it across all html pages and linked them together accordingly and tested responsivity.

* I then came back to the first page index.html and began to flesh it out with background colours, heading and text. I found a layout example I quite liked and manipulated it to do my bidding. I then took a little while longer than I'd like to admit in finding out how to center content vertically when the content wasn't the height of the view port. I kept running into trouble either having it all cram up to the top or content wouldn't settle. I asked classmates on slack if anyone had any idea how to solve this issue and after a couple suggestions I found the right fix. Unfortunately it left a coulpe pages with 2 .container divs. One being a "cover" container and the other a regular container. I'm not sure where I found it but I'm unsure how it was effecting responsiveness and alignment. I did read it is not recommended and will avoid in the future.

* After filling out the first page I built up a simple little footer to sit at the bottom of the page. I had a problem with smaller viewports that the links I added to my social media accounts would overlap content above. I fixed this by simply adjusting margins and padding within bootstrap tags and in some custom css.

* After making the footer with links to social media with font awesome icons I copied it across to all pages.

* I used some row and column for the about, portfolio and contact pages but only in a very simple form. I have been playing with more complex grid layouts elsewhere.

* I added a carousel to the portfolio as I was interested in how they worked and I liked how they looked. May remove in the future if not necessary.

* I used some media queries but only where things got a little too messy within bootstrap. I limited them as much as I could but unfortunately had to leave a few in there.

* I had no real problems with the form page as it is a nice simple and easy to write page

* Bootstrap makes getting the UI components down and on the page really quickly and easily allowing for more time to spent on testing for it being responsive

* From this assignment I learnt the importance of mobile first design. I made the mistake a few times getting caught up in personalized styling and not testing responsiveness and running into issues I could've easily avoided. Live and learn. I have taken this on board and will implement it into work going forward.


### Please note all bio info and text components aren't perfect as I hadn't thought it through. I feel as though it could be better
### Also my social media accounts are not set up professionally yet, that is on the cards for the next week or 2
